# algorithm_coen279

Algorithms can be hard to grasp. It's even harder if you're dealing with pseudocode and mathematical proof. Professor Sid's coen279 is one of the best classes that I have taken at SCU. But it can be a bit abstract at times. That's why I want to create this repo to keep a record of leetcode problems related to topics of the course. I know a lot of students are doing leetcode in preparation for job interviews. Then why not also take coen279 in parallel to develop an algorithmic level understanding that will surely be helpful for solving leetcode problems.

Leetcode is a great tool for learning data structures and algorithms with its huge collections of problems and active discussion forums. But beware of the pitfalls of leetcode. With leetcode, you could easily start writing code before you have the algorithm in mind. It should always be algorithm before implementation. Therefore, I'll try to include pseudocode along with Java implementation for every problem. Have fun leetcoding.
